  <button class="accordion">#600: ‘Added to basket' pop-up should only have 3-Level Information Hierarchy<span class="priority">Essential</span></button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>ISSUE: Users can be misled or disrupted by overlays without a clear focus on the confirmation of their actions and the next steps.
  </p>
  <p>
    RECOMMENDATION: The information hierachy should be:
   <ol>
     <li>Confirmation and visual indication of added to Basket</li>
     <li>Next options: Continue shopping, View basket & Checkout</li>
     <li>Complimentary and relevant cross-sell (optional)</li>

  <button class="accordion">#601: If using a drop-down basket, be very cautious about its interactive states<span class="priority impactful">Impactful</span></button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>ISSUE: A drop-down basket preview can be disruptive if minimized before the user can process and act on its information.
    </p>
    <p>A dropdown basket can make a user aware when an item has been added to their basket, but not explicitly asked to make a choice between 'continue shopping' or 'checkout now'. Basket drop-downs can be helpful to let users know how to proceed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      RECOMMENDATIONS:
     <ol>
      <li>Keep the drop-down basket permanently visible as long as users hover over the content.</li>
      <li>When users hover off the drop-down basket, have an exit delay of 300-500ms, to give users a chance to move the cursor back</li>
      <li>Have a good amount of padding on interactive options and avoid positioning too close to the edge</li>
       <li>If basket drop-down is auto-triggered after an item is 'added', if it auto-dismisses, have a minimum 7 second delay before it is auto-dismissed.</li>
       <li>Inline scrollable areas should be avoided in drop-down baskets. Instead, link to the basket to see overview of all items. Show only the just-added item but with clear indication of total cart value, quantity and a clear link for 'View basket'</li>
       <li>Allow drop-down basket to re-open </li>

  <button class="accordion">#602: Be cautious using a separate 'in-between page' after users add items to basket<span class="priority impactful">Impactful</span></button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>ISSUE: Users often mistake a separate in-between page displayed before the basket for an inadequate basket. 
  </p>
  <p>Users may not be ready to checkout after adding an item to their basket. It is best not to redirect users to other pages. Keeping the user on the Product Detail Page, or Product List Page performs better. When landing on a new page, users expect and mis-interpet it to be the basket page. 
  </p>
  <p>RECOMMENDATION 1: Keep users on the same page after 'adding to basket'. Immediately either have an 'added to basket' overlay or drop-down basket. 
  </p>
  <p>RECOMMENDATION 2: Do not have a separate page after adding to basket as this interupts the user's experience
  </p>
  <p>RECOMMENDATION 3: If having a separate page, there should be:
    <ol>
      <li>Clear visual indication and confirmatory messaging of 'Added to basket' for clarity (tick, green font colour for header, item with the price and thumbnail</li>
      <li>Clear visual empahsis on the primary paths to proceeding (ie. Shop more, View basket, Checkout now) </li>
      <li>If including cross-sell items, do not distract or obstruct the primary priority paths. Only have cross-sell items if they are relevant. If not relevant, do not have.</li>

  <button class="accordion">#603: Set strict design requirements if allowing users to skip the basket and go straight to checkout<span class="priority impactful">Impactful</span></button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>ISSUE: “Checkout Now” buttons shown before the cart cause some users to mistakenly skip the cart step, and thereby lack crucial order information, like total cost and the ability to modify their order.
  </p>
  <p>
  Allowing users to skip basket straight to checkout can be helpful for users who know exactly what they want, and they understand the differences between 'basket' and 'checkout'. For users who thought the next path would be 'basket', it can be problematic. 
  </p>
  <p>RECOMMENDATIONS:
    <ol>
      <li>Include a 'View basket' option next to 'checkout' option</li>
      <li>Avoid styling to nudge users to checkout and skip basket</li>
      <li>Avoid starting button labels with 'Continue' or 'Proceed'. Better performing labels are "View basket" and "Checkout now"</li>
    </ol>

  <button class="accordion">#732: Provide total order cost, or an estimate, in the basket<span class="priority">Essential</span></button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>ISSUE: Users want to know, or at least have an idea about, the total order cost before they have to fill out multiple form fields in later steps.
  </p>
<p>  When users do not understand how much they will have to pay for their order in total, they are reluctant to proceed to checkout. It can be very frustrating to only find the total amount at the end of the checkout if the total cost is too much (with added delivery cost or additional fees). Only showing order total at the end can result in abandonments and a negative perception of the site - 'tricking' users by showing an initial cheaper cost. 18% of users typically abandon because they couldnt see total order cost upfront before proceeding to checkout.</p>
<p>RECOMMENDATIONS:
  <ol>
    <li>Display an actual delivery cost if a fixed-rate or free</li>
    <li>If delivery cost varies, show an estimated delivery cost from the most popular slot. If using an estimate, it is good practice to use a tooltip or more information explaining what the estimate is based on.</li>
    <li>Display a price range from lowest possible delivery cost. "Delivery cost: £1-£4"</li>
    <li>If the basket qualifies for free delivery, explicitly state how they have met all conditions. Users want reassurance of seeing total order cost with free delivery. If there are spending tiers to qualify for free delivery, these should display automatically when the spend is reached</li>

  <button class="accordion">#620: Support that some users will use the basket as a comparison & storage tool<span class="priority">Essential</span></button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>ISSUE: Users sometimes use their basket to compare and store products, but many will find it difficult to use the basket to review items if it’s not optimised for comparison.
  </p>
  <p>Often users behaviour on ecommerce is non-linear as they find, review and purchase products. Many users use the basket as a 'temporary storage and comparison' tool. Only users who are completely predetermined (know what exactly what single product they need) will have a linear path from Product Detail Page to Checkout. For products with a lot of variants, customers go back and forth from Product List Page, to Product Detail Pages, to consider their options.
  </p>
  <p>Up to 25% of users will add items to their basket, without the intent to purchase all of them - but to compare them in basket later. The basket will effectively double as a 'Save' or 'Wishlist' feature. 22% of users use basket as somewhere to 'Save' items, compared to 7% who used site-provided 'Save' features. 
  </p>
  <p>RECOMMENDATIONS:
    <ol>
      <li>Provide large thumbnails in the basket for easier visual inspectation and comparison</li>
      <li>Include key product specifications and in the basket - Price, Product title, Product Variation, Thumbnail, Ratings (optional) </li>
      <li>Provide a link back to the Product Detail Page, by clicking the Product title or thumbnail </li>
      <li>Persist basket contents so the basket doubles as a 'Save' feature</li>
      <li>Consider allowing users to see variations and make direct changes in the basket (ie. Size and colour). This implemented well with an 'Edit' button that opens an overlay</li>
      <li>(Optional) on mobile, support the behaviour of continuing shop on another device with sending the saved basket to an email address. Any basket content should be in sync if signed in on multile devices.</li>
    </ol>

  <button class="accordion">#623: Autoupdate basket quantity changes instantly and allow quantity 0 to remove<span class="priority">Essential</span></button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>ISSUE: After setting a new quantity, users often overlook if they have to click anything else. Users assume quantity changes are autosaved, and if quantity is 0, the item would be removed.</p>
  <p>Users can have the need to change quantity in the basket for a number of reasons - accidentally adding twice, deciding cost is too much, or decided they need more.</p>
  <p>RECOMMENDATIONS:
    <ol>
      <li>Do not require users to click "Update" after changing product quantity in basket. Users will overlook the update button</li>
      <li>Update any quantity changes by autoupdating as soon as the value is changed.</li>
      <li>Once a new quanity is entered, the basket summary and order total must update immediately.</li>
      <li>If the item is set to quanity=0, this should remove the item from basket. Follow the mental model of 'quantity 0 = delete'</li>

  <button class="accordion">#622: Allow users to ‘Save for later’ basket items, and place saved items on basket page<span class="priority">Essential</span></button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>ISSUE: Sometimes users want to go ahead with a purchase, but also want to retain some basket items that are ‘interesting, but not for today’.
  </p>
  <p>25% of users use basket as for temporary storage and comparison of items - without the intent of immediately buying. Saving for later is a better option than 'remove from basket'.  
  </p>
  <p>
    RECOMMENDATION 1: Users expect the 'save' feature to be a basket feature - not a separate page. Have 'saved for later' items on basket page in a section. When users are on basket page, their saved items from a previous session should be there.
    Have some visual indication after an item has been selected as 'Save for later'. Have a link above the fold to the "Save for later" section on the basket
   </p>
   <p>
    RECOMMENDATION 2: Have a clear title for the "Saved items" section, such as "Saved for later (4)". Have clear actions on the items for "Move to basket" or "Delete"
   </p>
   <p>
    RECOMMENDATION 3: 'Save for later' should be for Guest and Registered users. Use a cookie to store saved items for guest users. When a user signs in, do not 'forget' their saved items. Guest saved items should be merged in with Signed in.

        <div class="panel">
        <p>ISSUE: Users are very hostile towards being forced to sign up for an account in order to place an order.
        </p>
        <p>28% of users typically abandon checkout due to forced account creation. Account creation is perceived to be significantly slower than guest checkout, as there are more form fields to fill. Extra effort is placed on the user to create and remember another account. Users also have a strong mental model of account creation = sent marketing material. Without forced account creation and providing guest checkout, websites tend to see a conversion rate improvement of 10-30%.
        </p>
        <p>
          RECOMMENDATION:
         <ol>
           <li>Offer a guest checkout option for new users, and a sign-in option for returning</li>
           <li>Create a 'delayed account creation' and present the account-creation option at the confirmation step (after order has been placed). With detailed benefits of creating an account.</li>

        <div class="panel">
        <p>ISSUE: Not being able to find guest checkout is as severe as if it wasn’t offered at all.
        </p>
        <p>If users can not easily see a guest checkout option, they will overlook and conclude no option exists. The design and position of the guest checkout option is essential. Users tend to interact with site elements that are placed in the upper left-hand portion of the interface more. On mobile, it is common for the guest checkout option to be overlooked if not in the viewport.
        </p>
        <p>
          RECOMMENDATION:
         <ol>
           <li>Offer a guest checkout option as the first choice and in the viewport</li>
           <li>Provide a clear path forward. Have a clear label to 'Guest checkout'. Avoid using a combined form to create an account or guest checkout, as this implies you need to add details before</li>
           <li>Place Guest checkout option to the left, or above of other account options. Use two options like: "Checkout as Guest" "Sign in to my account"</li>

        <div class="panel">
        <p>ISSUE: When faced with sign in options for social media accounts users seldom see them as primary options, and also often speculate if they grant the site permission to post.
        </p>
        <p>10% of ecommerce sites have a social media sign in option. If there is a social media sign in, it should be separated from the traditional email-based account creation. Users have privacy concerns when granting access, or dont trust sharing data.
        </p>
        <p>
          RECOMMENDATION:
         <ol>
           <li>Traditional email-based account creation should come first, before social sign in options</li>
           <li>Be transparent 'what will we have access to'. Explain if this is only as a shortcut to account creation and not posting messages on their behalf</li>

        <p>Strict password rules can cause up to an 18% checkout abandonment for existing customers when signing in. Users make the distinction between needed high security for accounts like banking. Users often re-use passwords across websites.

        </p>
        <p>While users should always be allowed to checkout as a guest, having an optional account-creation option is often appreciated by users. By having account creation later, checkout is far more efficient for new users with less form fields.

                                 <p>Address validators perform better when they show the differences between what the user had typed, and what the site was suggested are clearly emphasised. This helps users understand the purpose of the address validator, but more importantly increase the number of users who select the correct path for proceeding.
